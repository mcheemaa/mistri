# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

- `Mistri.agent` and `Mistri.provider`: build an agent or provider from a model
  id, inferring the provider and reading its key from the environment.

- Aborted and truncated turns now replay without provider errors: unusable
  thinking degrades to text, empty blocks are dropped, every tool call is
  paired, and budget-only models skip adaptive thinking.

- The error hierarchy: every Mistri failure rescues as `Mistri::Error`.
- The message protocol: immutable content blocks (text, thinking, image, tool call),
  messages with provider identity, usage accounting with cost math, stop reasons.
- The streaming event union: twelve event types, each carrying an immutable
  partial-message snapshot.
- `Mistri::Providers::Fake`: a scriptable provider for hermetic host tests.
- `Mistri::AbortSignal`: a thread-safe cancel latch with abort callbacks.
- `Mistri::SSE`: an incremental server-sent-events decoder.
- `Mistri::Transport`: a persistent per-provider streaming connection with
  status-mapped errors and hard abort of hung streams.
- `Mistri::PartialJson`: best-effort parsing of in-flight tool arguments.
- `Mistri::Models`: a capability catalog with graceful passthrough, so unknown
  models work the day they ship.
- `Mistri::Providers::Anthropic`: the Messages API streamed, with adaptive
  thinking, prompt caching, signature round-trips, and eager tool-input
  streaming.
- `Mistri::Providers::OpenAI`: the Responses API streamed and stateless, with
  encrypted reasoning replay and thinking summaries.
- `Mistri::Providers::Gemini`: generateContent streamed, with unconstrained
  thinking by default and verbatim thought-signature replay.
- `Mistri::Agent`: the streaming tool-calling loop, persisting each turn as it
  completes so aborts and crashes resume without repair.
- `Mistri::Tool` and `Mistri::Schema`: define tools with a raw JSON Schema or a
  Ruby schema block; results may be text, JSON, or content blocks.
- `Mistri::Session` with pluggable stores (`Memory`, `JSONL`, and an optional
  `ActiveRecord` adapter for the host's own database).
- `Mistri::Budget`: opt-in ceilings on turns, tokens, cost, and wall-clock;
  nothing is enforced unless the host sets it.
